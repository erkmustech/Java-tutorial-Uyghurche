		When chipmonks get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A chipmonk party is successfull when the 
		number of cigars is between 40 and 60. Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. Write a method that accepts number of cigars and a boolean for weekend, and prints true if the party with the given values is successful, or false otherwise.
